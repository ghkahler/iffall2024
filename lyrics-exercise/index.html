            <p>To take my love away<br>
                When I come back around, will I know what to say?<br>
                Said you won't forget my name <br>
                Not today, not tomorrow<br>
                Kinda strange, feelin' sorrow<br>
                I got change (Yup), you could borrow (Borrow)<br>
                When I come back around, will I know what to say?<br>
                Not today, maybe tomorrow</p>

            <p>Open up the door, can you open up the door? <br>
                I know you said before you can't cope with any more<br>
                You told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store<br>
                I hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door?</p>

            <p>Did you take<br>
                My love away<br>
                From me? Me Me</p>
            <p>Saw your seat at the counter when I looked away<br>
                Saw you turn around, but it wasn't your face<br>
                Said, "I need to be alone now, I'm takin' a break"<br>
                How come when I returned, you were gone away?</p>
            <p>I don't, I don't know why I called<br>
                I don't know you at all<br>
                I don't know you<br>
                Not at all<br>
                I don't, I don't know why I called<br>
                I don't know you at all<br>
                I don't know you</p>
            <p>Did you take<br>
                My love away<br>
                From me? Me</p>
            <p>And that's when you found me</p>
            <p>I was waitin' in the garden<br>
                Contemplatin', beg your pardon<br>
                But there's a part of me that recognizes you<br>
                Do you feel it too?<br>
                When you told me it was serious<br>
                Were you serious? Mm<br>
                They told me they were only curious<br>
                Now it's serious, mm</p>
            <p>Open up the door, can you open up the door?<br>
                I know you said before you can't cope with any more<br>
                You told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store<br>
                I hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door?</p>
            <p>Wringing my hands in my lap<br>
                And they tell me it's all been a trap<br>
                And you don't know if you'll make it back<br>
                I said, "No, don't say that"</p>
            <p>(Wringing my hands in my lap)<br>
                (And you tell me it's all been a trap)<br>
                (And you don't know if you'll make it back)<br>
                (But I said, "No, don't say that")<br>
                (Wringing my hands in my lap)<br>
                (Tell me it's all been a trap)<br>
                (Don't know if you'll make it back)<br>
                (Don't say that)<br>
                Hm-hm</p>
