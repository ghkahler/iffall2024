        <p class="description">In 1985, The Times published a recipe for the blueberry muffins served at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in <br>Boston, which Marian Burros, who adapted the recipe, judged among her favorite muffins in the city.<br>A few years later, a reader wrote Marian to say that the best blueberry muffins in Boston were in fact<br>from the now-closed Jordan Marsh department store. Marian tracked down and adapted that recipe<br>so you can judge for yourself. But the origins of the Jordan Marsh recipe were unclear until 2023,<br>when Mara Richmond of Burlington, Vt., wrote The Times to say that the developer of the recipe was<br>her father, Arnold Gitlin, then the executive food consultant for Allied Stores, which owned Jordan<br>Marsh at the time. His recipe, Richmond said, was an adaptation from one in Esther Howland’s 1847<br>cookbook, “The New England Economical Housekeeper, and Family Receipt Book.” Everything old is<br>new again. This version has a lot more sugar and butter and fewer eggs than the Ritz-Carlton muffins.<br>It also calls for mashing a half cup of berries and adding them to the batter. This produces a very<br>moist muffin, one that will stay fresh longer.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p class="crimson-text-regular">Preheat the oven to 375.</p>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p class="crimson-text-regular-italic">Cream the butter and sugar until light.</p>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p class="crimson-text-regular-italic">Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after<br>each addition. Add vanilla.</p>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p class="crimson-text-regular-italic">Sift together the flour, salt and baking powder,<br> and add to the creamed mixture alternately with the milk.</p>
        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <p class="crimson-text-regular-italic">Crush ½ cup blueberries with a fork, and mix<br>into the batter. Fold in the remaining whole berries.</p>
        <h4>Step 6</h4>
        <p class="crimson-text-regular-italic">Line a 12 cup standard muffin tin with cupcake<br>liners, and fill with batter. Sprinkle the 3 teaspoons<br>sugar over the tops of the muffins, and bake at 375<br>degrees for about 30-35 minutes.</p>
        <h4>Step 7</h4>

        <h2>Other Recipe Websites</h2>
        <p class="description"><b><a href="//www.justonecookbook.com">Just One Cookbook</a></b> - This website is one that I use a lot and I like how neat and organized the page<br>looks. There are plenty of images that draw the viewer in but it's also not too overwhelming. I also like<br>how at the top there are tags to filter the recipes into weeknight, bento, sweets, and tips sections.</p>
        <p class="description"><b><a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/how-to-make-avocado-toast-8711220">Martha Stewart</a></b> - I looked at how the specific recipe page is organized on this website and I noticed <br> that there is a progress bar and table of context box on the side of the page. It's interactive, so depending<br>on which section you're scrolling through it will tell you how far you are in the recipe. I also like how there<br>are more conversational segments throuhgout the recipe, such as whether to "smash" or "mash" the<br>avocado.</p>
        
        <p class="description"><b><a href="https://www.culinaryhill.com/blueberry-muffins/">Culinary Hill</a></b> - I searched up another blueberry muffin recipe for comparison, and noticed some differ-<br>ences in the layout. A progress photo follows each step, but I also noticed that at the there is a summary<br>page with step to step instructions at the very end.</p>

       <h2>Non-Recipe Websites</h2>
       <p class="description"><b><a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/training/a760084/the-perfect-10k/">Runner's World</a></b> - What I like about this article is the visual contrast and orgnaization. You can "jump to"<br> certain sections of the page in the table of contents box at the top of the page. This can similarly be<br>applied for a recipe where you can jump to ingredients or get right to the steps.</p>
       <p class="description"><b><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Tennis">WikiHow</a></b> - The pages on wikihow have a very distinct look and are uniform throughout. Each section<br>of information is placed into a block with an image/illustation tacked on and a bolded number tracking<br>the steps. A tips and comments section is listed below which is helpful and could be used in a recipe page.</p>
       <p class="description"><b><a href="https://www.scribbr.com/category/graduate-school/">Scribbr</a></b> - This is a great example of an interactive page that has a table of contents at the top that follows<br>you as you scroll down. When you hover over the box, it folds open and will direct you to a list of the sections.<br>I thought this was a nice addition and a new way to think about organizing the page.</p>
